<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>

<p>Hello, my name is vishv balar, and I’m a computer science major. I have experience with several programming languages, including Java, Python, and SQL. I’m particularly interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and I’m currently working on a project that involves developing an AI-powered chatbot.</p>

<p>Last semester, I worked on a team project that involved developing a mobile app for tracking fitness goals. I learned a lot about software development processes and project management during that experience.</P>

<P>After graduation, I hope to work as a software engineer at a tech company, where I can continue to develop my skills and contribute to innovative projects. In my free time, I enjoy attending hackathons and learning about new technologies in the field.</p>
